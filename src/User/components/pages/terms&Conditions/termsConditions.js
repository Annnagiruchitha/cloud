        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p>We collect information on and through our Services. The specific types of information
         we collect vary depending on the nature of our relationship with you and how you choose 
         to interact with us but may include personal data. Generally, we collect information in 
         three main ways: A) when you provide it to us, B) automatically when you use the Services, and C) 
         from service providers and third parties.</p>
        <p>You can provide us with different kinds of information depending on how you interact with the
         Services. Sometimes we'll ask you to provide specific pieces of information, such as where we 
         require it to provide parts of the Services to you (for example, by prompting you to complete
         an online registration process). If we ask you to provide us with information in these cases and 
         you choose not to, you may not be able to access the relevant Services and/or some features may 
         not operate as intended. For instance, to register as a user and create a profile, you'll need 
         to provide us with basic registration information like your name, a public-facing display name, 
         and password, country that you live in, and email address. If you want to make a purchase or become 
         a seller, we ask that you provide payment-related information (like your e-mail address, VAT number, 
         and business location).</p>
         <p>We also collect the information you voluntarily provide as part of your user profile 
        (like avatar, biography, skills, and interests), to sign up for email alerts, use social features 
        and forums (likes, follows, comments, search queries), use our tools (including to create and publish 
        images and other content), complete surveys, or contact us for customer support. If you enter a 
        contest or competitive event, we'll collect your application information and other information we may 
        need to help confirm your eligibility and process rewards. We collect whatever information you choose 
        to provide to us in those or other similar cases.</p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect Automatically:</h2>
        <p>We collect some information automatically when you visit, access, or use the Services. This includes
         information about your site or application usage, user interactions, purchases, and other activity in the 
         Services, typically associated with your account profile or with an identifier we have assigned to your 
         device or profile. While the specific types of information that we automatically collect may vary, they 
         generally include:</p>

         <p>Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access our Services,
            such as IP address, device identifiers, your internet service provider, plugins, or other transactional 
            or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating 
            systems and browsers, or other device or system-related specifications);</p>

        <p>The general location of your device, which we typically derive from your device's IP address.</p>

        <p>The Services use technologies such as cookies, log files, and web beacons to automatically collect the types 
        of information listed above. Some of these technologies may create small files or record-keeping tools that may 
        be stored on your device. They help us, our service providers, and third parties recognize your device and provide 
        information about how you use and interact with the Services. For example, they support our ability to authenticate
        users, remember preferences, personalize experiences, and conduct data analytics. Please see the "Cookies" section 
        below of this Privacy Policy for further information about what information will be automatically collected 
        when you visit our Services.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or the privacy practices of Corlmart please email us at 
        support@corlmart.com or write to us at: A3, Ponni Amman Kovil 2nd Cross Street, Madipakkam, Chennai - 600 091.</p>
